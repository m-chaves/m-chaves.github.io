## About me

I'm a **statistician and data scientist** with 7 years of working experience in data modeling, visualization, extraction, and transformation. 
Recently, I have been researching explainable and interpretable AI. 
In particular, prototype-based interpretable neural networks and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
More broadly, I have been working with natural language processing and text classification models.     
These projects took place as part of [I3S laboratory](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/) in a combined effort with the [MAASAI team at INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/maasai/).
