## About me

I am a research engineer at [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and a member of the [WIMMICS team](https://www.inria.fr/en/wimmics) at Inria, where I work on natural language processing (NLP) and argument mining applied to the context of political debates, press articles, and social media.
In my 7 years of working experience, I have developed diverse projects involving statistics, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
This includes applications in social media analysis, gender representation in media, explainable AI, supply chain logistics, and money laundering detection.


<!-- I'm a **statistician and data scientist** with 7 years of working experience in data modeling, visualization, extraction, and transformation.
Recently, I have been researching natural language processing techniques and text models in the context of fallacy detection and classification.
I also worked in explainable and interpretable AI.
In particular, with prototype-based interpretable neural networks and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). -->
