## About me

I'm a **statistician and data scientist** with 7 years of working experience in data modeling, visualization, extraction, and transformation. 
Recently, I have been researching natural language processing techniques and text models in the context of fallacy detection and classification. 
I also worked in explainable and interpretable AI. 
In particular, with prototype-based interpretable neural networks and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).

## Work experience

### Research

> **RESEARCH ENGINEER**  
> **[INRIA, WIMMICS team](https://www.inria.fr/en/wimmics) and [I3S laboratory](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/), France** | *April 2023 - Present*
> 
> Research in natural language processing (NLP) focused on models and techniques that utilize argumentation and other text data derived features to identify propaganda in social media and political debate contexts.


> **INTERNSHIP**  
> **[I3S laboratory](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/) and [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/maasai/research/), France** | *March 2022 - August 2022*
> 
> Worked on prototype-based interpretable neural networks approaches for text classification. This study lies on the framework of ANR TRACTIVE, a project that regroups researchers several disciplines for the understanding of gender representation in visual media. It involved implementing various NLP techniques and text classification models.  

> **INTERNSHIP**  
> **[Université Côte d’Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/laboratoires/laboratoire-jean-alexandre-dieudonne-ljad-1) and [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/maasai/research/), France** | *April 2021 - July 2021*
> 
> Worked on model agnostic interpretability methods in the ambit of images. More specifically, improving resampling process for LIME. Read the full work [here](https://m-chaves.github.io/LIME_resampling_methods.pdf).

### Industry

> **JUNIOR DATA SCIENTIST**  
> **Walmart Supply Chain Analytics USA** | *October 2018 - July 2020*
> 
> Directed and developed data analysis projects to provide agile solutions to business partners. Main projects included an anomaly detection system, statistical sampling design, and consumption layer design.

> **DATA ANALYST**  
> **Walmart Supply Chain Analytics USA** | *January 2017 - October 2018*
> 
> Worked in data extraction, transformation, and visualization. Main projects included statistical process control techniques and KPI development.

> **DATA ANALYST**  
> **BAC Credomatic Regional Compliance Management, Costa Rica** | *April 2016 - December 2016*
> 
> Developed money laundering detection models for five Central American countries.
